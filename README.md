# SayChiz

A tiny demo app to teach intro to client-side web dev. A user takes a selfie with it, and the app indicates the emotion it can see.

It's part of a 5-hour workshop that goes from zero background in programming to a mobile web app. The technology used includes [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [jQuery](https://jquery.com), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [Microsoft Cognitive Services - Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api).

## Setup

To run it, clone the this git repo. Then go to the [Microsoft Cognitive Services - Subscription page](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions?productId=/products/5639d8afca73072154c1ce88) and get yourself an API key. You do this by logging in, and choosing the **Emotion API**.

The API key should like something like `e0b5b29480894ae6b192b98380dd550d`. Once you have it, plug it in the first line of `script.js`. Then you can run `index.html` locally or from a web server.
